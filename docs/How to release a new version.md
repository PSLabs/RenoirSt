How to release a new version
============================

This is a checklist of required tasks to do for a release:

- Create a release in GitHub with the version
- Update `stable-pharo-40` and `stable-pharo-50` pointing to the corresponding commit
- Review and update if necessary the Pharo Enterprise Book chapter

For a major release
- Copy the updated Metacello configuration to the MetaRepoForPharo if needed
