HSL colors are encoding as a triple (hue, saturation, lightness). 
Hue is represented as an angle of the color circle. 
Saturation and lightness are represented as percentages. 100% is full saturation, and 0% is a shade of gray. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is “normal”.
